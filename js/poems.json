      "poem": "1<br>I sing the body electric,<br>The armies of those I love engirth me and I engirth them,<br>They will not let me off till I go with them, respond to them,<br>And discorrupt them, and charge them full with the charge of the soul.<br><br>Was it doubted that those who >>CORRUPT their own bodies conceal themselves?<br>And if those who defile the living are as bad as they who defile the dead?<br>And if the body does not do fully as much as the soul?<br>And if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?<br><br>2<br>The love of the body of man or woman balks account, the body itself balks account,<br>That of the male is perfect, and that of the female is perfect.<br><br>The expression of the face balks account,<br>But the expression of a well-made man appears not only in his face,<br>It is in his limbs and joints also, it is curiously in the joints of his hips and wrists,<br>It is in his walk, the carriage of his neck, the flex of his waist and knees, dress does not hide him,<br>The strong sweet quality he has strikes through the cotton and broadcloth,<br>To see him pass conveys as much as the best poem, perhaps more,<br>You linger to see his back, and the back of his neck and shoulder-side.<br><br>The sprawl and fulness of babes, the bosoms and heads of women, the folds of their dress, their style as we pass in the street, the contour of their shape downwards,<br>The swimmer naked in the swimming-bath, seen as he swims through the transparent green-shine, or lies with his face up and rolls silently to and fro in the heave of the water,<br>The bending forward and backward of rowers in row-boats, the horseman in his saddle,<br>Girls, mothers, house-keepers, in all their performances,<br>The group of laborers seated at noon-time with their open dinner-kettles, and their wives waiting,<br>The female soothing a child, the farmer’s daughter in the garden or cow-yard,<br>The young fellow hoeing corn, the sleigh-driver driving his six horses through the crowd,<br>The wrestle of wrestlers, two apprentice-boys, quite grown, lusty, good-natured, native-born, out on the vacant lot at sun-down after work,<br>The coats and caps thrown down, the embrace of love and resistance,<br>The upper-hold and under-hold, the hair rumpled over and blinding the eyes;<br>The march of firemen in their own costumes, the play of masculine muscle through clean-setting trowsers and waist-straps,<br>The slow return from the fire, the pause when the bell strikes suddenly again, and the listening on the alert,<br>The natural, perfect, varied attitudes, the bent head, the curv’d neck and the counting;<br>Such-like I love—I loosen myself, pass freely, am at the mother’s breast with the little child,<br>Swim with the swimmers, wrestle with wrestlers, march in line with the firemen, and pause, listen, count.<br><br>3<br>I knew a man, a common farmer, the father of five sons,<br>And in them the fathers of sons, and in them the fathers of sons.<br><br>This man was of wonderful vigor, calmness, beauty of person,<br>The shape of his head, the pale yellow and white of his hair and beard, the immeasurable meaning of his black eyes, the richness and breadth of his manners,<br>These I used to go and visit him to see, he was wise also,<br>He was six feet tall, he was over eighty years old, his sons were massive, clean, bearded, tan-faced, handsome,<br>They and his daughters loved him, all who saw him loved him,<br>They did not love him by allowance, they loved him with personal love,<br>He drank water only, the blood show’d like scarlet through the clear-brown skin of his face,<br>He was a frequent gunner and fisher, he sail’d his boat himself, he had a fine one presented to him by a ship-joiner, he had fowling-pieces presented to him by men that loved him,<br>When he went with his five sons and many grand-sons to hunt or fish, you would pick him out as the most beautiful and vigorous of the gang,<br>You would wish long and long to be with him, you would wish to sit by him in the boat that you and he might touch each other.<br><br>4<br>I have perceiv’d that to be with those I like is enough,<br>To stop in company with the rest at evening is enough,<br>To be surrounded by beautiful, curious, breathing, laughing flesh is enough,<br>To pass among them or touch any one, or rest my arm ever so lightly round his or her neck for a moment, what is this then?<br>I do not ask any more delight, I swim in it as in a sea.<br><br>There is something in staying close to men and women and looking on them, and in the contact and odor of them, that pleases the soul well,<br>All things please the soul, but these please the soul well.<br><br>5<br>This is the female form,<br>A divine nimbus exhales from it from head to foot,<br>It attracts with fierce undeniable attraction,<br>I am drawn by its breath as if I were no more than a helpless vapor, all falls aside but myself and it,<br>Books, art, religion, time, the visible and solid earth, and what was expected of heaven or fear’d of hell, are now consumed,<br>Mad filaments, ungovernable shoots play out of it, the response likewise ungovernable,<br>Hair, bosom, hips, bend of legs, negligent falling hands all diffused, mine too diffused,<br>Ebb stung by the flow and flow stung by the ebb, love-flesh swelling and deliciously aching,<br>Limitless limpid jets of love hot and enormous, quivering jelly of love, white-blow and delirious juice,<br>Bridegroom night of love working surely and softly into the prostrate dawn,<br>Undulating into the willing and yielding day,<br>Lost in the cleave of the clasping and sweet-flesh’d day.<br><br>This the nucleus—after the child is born of woman, man is born of woman,<br>This the bath of birth, this the merge of small and large, and the outlet again.<br><br>Be not ashamed women, your privilege encloses the rest, and is the exit of the rest,<br>You are the gates of the body, and you are the gates of the soul.<br><br>The female contains all qualities and tempers them,<br>She is in her place and moves with perfect balance,<br>She is all things duly veil’d, she is both passive and active,<br>She is to conceive daughters as well as sons, and sons as well as daughters.<br><br>As I see my soul reflected in Nature,<br>As I see through a mist, One with inexpressible completeness, sanity, beauty,<br>See the bent head and arms folded over the breast, the Female I see.<br><br>6<br>The male is not less the soul nor more, he too is in his place,<br>He too is all qualities, he is action and power,<br>The flush of the known universe is in him,<br>Scorn becomes him well, and appetite and defiance become him well,<br>The wildest largest passions, bliss that is utmost, sorrow that is utmost become him well, pride is for him,<br>The full-spread pride of man is calming and excellent to the soul,<br>Knowledge becomes him, he likes it always, he brings every thing to the test of himself,<br>Whatever the survey, whatever the sea and the sail he strikes soundings at last only here,<br>(Where else does he strike soundings except here?)<br><br>The man’s body is sacred and the woman’s body is sacred,<br>No matter who it is, it is sacred—is it the meanest one in the laborers’ gang?<br>Is it one of the dull-faced immigrants just landed on the wharf?<br>Each belongs here or anywhere just as much as the well-off, just as much as you,<br>Each has his or her place in the procession.<br><br>(All is a procession,<br>The universe is a procession with measured and perfect motion.)<br><br>Do you know so much yourself that you call the meanest ignorant?<br>Do you suppose you have a right to a good sight, and he or she has no right to a sight?<br>Do you think matter has cohered together from its diffuse float, and the soil is on the surface, and water runs and vegetation sprouts,<br>For you only, and not for him and her?<br><br>7<br>A man’s body at auction,<br>(For before the war I often go to the slave-mart and watch the sale,)<br>I help the auctioneer, the sloven does not half know his business.<br><br>Gentlemen look on this wonder,<br>Whatever the bids of the bidders they cannot be high enough for it,<br>For it the globe lay preparing quintillions of years without one animal or plant,<br>For it the revolving cycles truly and steadily roll’d.<br><br>In this head the all-baffling brain,<br>In it and below it the makings of heroes.<br><br>Examine these limbs, red, black, or white, they are cunning in tendon and nerve,<br>They shall be stript that you may see them.<br><br>Exquisite senses, life-lit eyes, pluck, volition,<br>Flakes of breast-muscle, pliant backbone and neck, flesh not flabby, good-sized arms and legs,<br>And wonders within there yet.<br><br>Within there runs blood,<br>The same old blood! the same red-running blood!<br>There swells and jets a heart, there all passions, desires, reachings, aspirations,<br>(Do you think they are not there because they are not express’d in parlors and lecture-rooms?)<br><br>This is not only one man, this the father of those who shall be fathers in their turns,<br>In him the start of populous states and rich republics,<br>Of him countless immortal lives with countless embodiments and enjoyments.<br><br>How do you know who shall come from the offspring of his offspring through the centuries?<br>(Who might you find you have come from yourself, if you could trace back through the centuries?)<br><br>8<br>A woman’s body at auction,<br>She too is not only herself, she is the teeming mother of mothers,<br>She is the bearer of them that shall grow and be mates to the mothers.<br><br>Have you ever loved the body of a woman?<br>Have you ever loved the body of a man?<br>Do you not see that these are exactly the same to all in all nations and times all over the earth?<br><br>If any thing is sacred the human body is sacred,<br>And the glory and sweet of a man is the token of manhood untainted,<br>And in man or woman a clean, strong, firm-fibred body, is more beautiful than the most beautiful face.<br><br>Have you seen the fool that corrupted his own live body? or the fool that corrupted her own live body?<br>For they do not conceal themselves, and cannot conceal themselves.<br><br>9<br>O my body! I dare not desert the likes of you in other men and women, nor the likes of the parts of you,<br>I believe the likes of you are to stand or fall with the likes of the soul, (and that they are the soul,)<br>I believe the likes of you shall stand or fall with my poems, and that they are my poems,<br>Man’s, woman’s, child’s, youth’s, wife’s, husband’s, mother’s, father’s, young man’s, young woman’s poems,<br>Head, neck, hair, ears, drop and tympan of the ears,<br>Eyes, eye-fringes, iris of the eye, eyebrows, and the waking or sleeping of the lids,<br>Mouth, tongue, lips, teeth, roof of the mouth, jaws, and the jaw-hinges,<br>Nose, nostrils of the nose, and the partition,<br>Cheeks, temples, forehead, chin, throat, back of the neck, neck-slue,<br>Strong shoulders, manly beard, scapula, hind-shoulders, and the ample side-round of the chest,<br>Upper-arm, armpit, elbow-socket, lower-arm, arm-sinews, arm-bones,<br>Wrist and wrist-joints, hand, palm, knuckles, thumb, forefinger, finger-joints, finger-nails,<br>Broad breast-front, curling hair of the breast, breast-bone, breast-side,<br>Ribs, belly, backbone, joints of the backbone,<br>Hips, hip-sockets, hip-strength, inward and outward round, man-balls, man-root,<br>Strong set of thighs, well carrying the trunk above,<br>Leg fibres, knee, knee-pan, upper-leg, under-leg,<br>Ankles, instep, foot-ball, toes, toe-joints, the heel;<br>All attitudes, all the shapeliness, all the belongings of my or your body or of any one’s body, male or female,<br>The lung-sponges, the stomach-sac, the bowels sweet and clean,<br>The brain in its folds inside the skull-frame,<br>Sympathies, heart-valves, palate-valves, sexuality, maternity,<br>Womanhood, and all that is a woman, and the man that comes from woman,<br>The womb, the teats, nipples, breast-milk, tears, laughter, weeping, love-looks, love-perturbations and risings,<br>The voice, articulation, language, whispering, shouting aloud,<br>Food, drink, pulse, digestion, sweat, sleep, walking, swimming,<br>Poise on the hips, leaping, reclining, embracing, arm-curving and tightening,<br>The continual changes of the flex of the mouth, and around the eyes,<br>The skin, the sunburnt shade, freckles, hair,<br>The curious sympathy one feels when feeling with the hand the naked meat of the body,<br>The circling rivers the breath, and breathing it in and out,<br>The beauty of the waist, and thence of the hips, and thence downward toward the knees,<br>The thin red jellies within you or within me, the bones and the marrow in the bones,<br>The exquisite realization of health;<br>O I say these are not the parts and poems of the body only, but of the soul,<br>O I say now these are the soul!"

supernatural darkness of cold-water flats floating across the tops of cities contemplating jazz,<br>who bared their brains to Heaven under the El and saw Mohammedan angels staggering on tenement roofs illuminated,<br>who passed through universities with radiant cool eyes hallucinating Arkansas and Blake-light tragedy among the scholars of war,<br>who were expelled from the academies for crazy & publishing obscene odes on the windows of the skull,<br>who cowered in unshaven rooms in underwear, burning their money in wastebaskets and listening to the Terror through the wall,<br>who got busted in their pubic beards returning through Laredo with a belt of marijuana for New York,<br>who ate fire in paint hotels or drank turpentine in Paradise Alley, death, or purgatoried their torsos night after night<br>with dreams, with drugs, with waking nightmares, alcohol and cock and endless balls,<br>incomparable blind streets of shuddering cloud and lightning in the mind leaping toward poles of Canada & Paterson, illuminating all the motionless world of Time between,<br>Peyote solidities of halls, backyard green tree cemetery dawns, wine drunkenness over the rooftops, storefront boroughs of teahead joyride neon blinking traffic light, sun and moon and tree vibrations in the roaring winter dusks of Brooklyn, ashcan rantings and kind king light of mind,<br>who chained themselves to subways for the endless ride from Battery to holy Bronx on benzedrine until the noise of wheels and children brought them down shuddering mouth-wracked and battered bleak of brain all drained of brilliance in the drear light of Zoo,<br>who sank all night in submarine light of Bickford’s floated out and sat through the stale beer afternoon in desolate Fugazzi's, listening to the crack of doom on the hydrogen jukebox,<br>who talked continuously seventy hours from park to pad to bar to Bellevue to museum to the Brooklyn Bridge,<br>a lost battalion of platonic conversationalists jumping down the stoops off fire escapes off windowsills off Empire State out of the moon,<br>yacketayakking screaming vomiting whispering facts and memories and anecdotes and eyeball kicks and shocks of hospitals and jails and wars,<br>whole intellects disgorged in total recall for seven days and nights with brilliant eyes, meat for the Synagogue cast on the pavement,<br>who vanished into nowhere Zen New Jersey leaving a trail of ambiguous picture postcards of Atlantic City Hall,<br>suffering Eastern sweats and Tangerian bone-grindings and migraines of China under junk-withdrawal in Newark’s bleak furnished room,   <br>who wandered around and around at midnight in the railroad yard wondering where to go, and went, leaving no broken hearts,<br>who lit >>CIGARETTES in boxcars boxcars boxcars racketing through snow toward lonesome farms in grandfather night,<br>who studied Plotinus Poe St. John of the Cross telepathy and bop kabbalah because the cosmos instinctively vibrated at their feet in Kansas,

womb and the one eyed shrew that does nothing but sit on her ass and snip the intellectual golden threads of the craftsman’s loom,<br>who copulated ecstatic and insatiate with a bottle of beer a sweetheart a package of cigarettes a candle and fell off the bed, and continued along the floor and down the hall and ended fainting on the wall with a vision of ultimate cunt and come eluding the last gyzym of consciousness,<br>who sweetened the snatches of a million girls trembling in the sunset, and were red eyed in the morning but prepared to sweeten the snatch of the sunrise, flashing buttocks under barns and naked in the lake,<br>who went out whoring through Colorado in myriad stolen night-cars, N.C., secret hero of these poems, cocksman and Adonis of Denver—joy to the memory of his innumerable lays of girls in empty lots & diner backyards, moviehouses’ rickety rows, on mountaintops in caves or with gaunt waitresses in familiar roadside lonely petticoat upliftings &

basements hung-over with heartless Tokay and horrors of Third Avenue iron dreams & stumbled to unemployment offices,<br>who walked all night with their shoes full of blood on the snowbank docks waiting for a door in the East River to open to a room full of steam-heat and opium,<br>who created great suicidal dramas on the apartment cliff-banks of the Hudson under the wartime blue floodlight of the moon & their heads shall be crowned with laurel in oblivion,<br>who ate the lamb stew of the imagination or digested the crab at the muddy bottom of the rivers of Bowery,<br>who wept at the romance of the streets with their pushcarts full of onions and bad music,<br>who sat in boxes breathing in the darkness under the bridge, and rose up to build harpsichords in their lofts,<br>who coughed on the sixth floor of Harlem crowned with flame under the tubercular sky surrounded by orange crates of theology,<br>who scribbled all night rocking and rolling over lofty incantations which

wrists three times successively unsuccessfully, gave up and were forced to open antique stores where they thought they were growing old and cried,<br>who were burned alive in their innocent flannel suits on Madison Avenue amid blasts of leaden verse & the tanked-up clatter of the iron regiments of fashion & the nitroglycerine shrieks of the fairies of advertising & the mustard gas of sinister intelligent editors, or were run down by the drunken taxicabs of Absolute Reality,<br>who jumped off the Brooklyn Bridge this actually happened and walked away unknown and forgotten into the ghostly daze of Chinatown soup alleyways & firetrucks, not even one free beer,<br>who sang out of their windows in despair, fell out of the subway window, jumped in the filthy Passaic, leaped on negroes, cried all over the street, danced on broken wineglasses barefoot smashed phonograph records of nostalgic European 1930s German jazz finished the whiskey and threw up groaning into the bloody toilet, moans in their ears and the blast of colossal steamwhistles,<br>who barreled down the highways of the past journeying to each other’s hotrod-Golgotha jail-solitude watch or Birmingham jazz incarnation,<br>who drove crosscountry seventytwo hours to find out if I had a vision or you had a vision or he had a vision to find out Eternity,<br>who journeyed to Denver, who died in Denver, who came back to Denver & waited in vain, who watched over Denver & brooded & loned in Denver and finally went away to find out the Time, & now Denver is lonesome for her heroes,<br>who fell on their knees in hopeless cathedrals praying for each other’s salvation and light and breasts, until the soul illuminated its hair for a second,<br>who crashed through their minds in jail waiting for impossible criminals with golden heads and the charm of reality in their hearts who sang sweet blues to Alcatraz,<br>who retired to Mexico to cultivate a habit, or Rocky Mount to tender Buddha or Tangiers to boys or Southern Pacific to the black locomotive or Harvard to Narcissus to Woodlawn to the daisychain or grave,<br>who demanded sanity trials accusing the radio of hypnotism & were left with their insanity & their hands & a hung jury,<br>who threw potato salad at CCNY lecturers on Dadaism and subsequently presented themselves on the granite steps of the madhouse with shaven heads and harlequin speech of suicide, demanding instantaneous lobotomy,<br>and who were given instead the concrete void of insulin Metrazol electricity hydrotherapy psychotherapy occupational therapy pingpong & amnesia,<br>who in humorless protest overturned only one symbolic pingpong table, resting briefly in catatonia,<br>returning years later truly bald except for a wig of blood, and tears and fingers, to the visible madman doom of the wards of the madtowns of the East,<br>Pilgrim State’s Rockland’s and Greystone’s foetid halls, bickering with the echoes of the soul, rocking and rolling in the midnight solitude-bench dolmen-realms of love, dream of life a nightmare, bodies turned to stone as heavy as the moon,<br>with mother finally ******, and the last fantastic book flung out of the tenement window, and the last door closed at 4 A.M. and the last telephone slammed at the wall in reply and the last furnished room emptied down to the last piece of mental furniture, a yellow paper rose twisted on a wire hanger in the closet, and even that imaginary, nothing but a hopeful little bit of hallucination—<br>ah, Carl, while you are not safe I am not safe, and now you’re really in the total animal soup of time—<br>and who therefore ran through the icy streets obsessed with a sudden flash of the alchemy of the use of the ellipsis catalogue a variable measure and the vibrating plane,<br>who dreamt and made incarnate gaps in Time & Space through images juxtaposed, and trapped the archangel of the soul between 2 visual images and joined the elemental verbs and set the noun

shaking with shame, rejected yet confessing out the soul to conform to the rhythm of thought in his naked and endless head,<br>the madman bum and angel beat in Time, unknown, yet putting down here what might be left to say in time come after death,<br>and rose reincarnate in the ghostly clothes of jazz in the goldhorn shadow of the band and blew the suffering of America’s naked mind for love
