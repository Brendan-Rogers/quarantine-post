      "content": "Pine Meadows contains one million smells. <br><br> Over the past few weeks, I’ve delivered around 2 dozens RX bags, pill packs, and general bags of random OTC (over the counter) junk to that big scary building, and it’s never once smelled the same. <br><br> This place is like a labyrinth, its twisty turns hide new bizarre thrills behind every spooky corner. I mean, this real life place is like some kinda god damn Halloween trick or treat house, but instead of a big ol' bag of candy, I’m carrying a small ol’ plastic basket of Zopiclone or whatever. <br><br> Lets go on a tour. The first smell in Pine Meadows is cigarettes. We’re starting off strong. After I buzz in, we quickly transition to pee smell. Classic. We gun it down the hallway towards the stairs today, and that pee smell becomes weed smell. My opinion on the smell of weed is nuanced, but my position on the smell of combination weed and pee is not. That shit is GNARLED. <br><br> Now we’re upstairs, and things are getting weird. The first odour hitting our old-factories in Chicken Nuggies. Its very, weirdly intense, and brings us right back to the good ol days. We’re knocking on doors now, and every one opens the eyes of our nose to a bizarre new dimension. <br><br>These smells, I cannot define. They are lovecraftian, bizarre. They smell like concepts and ideals, loss, poverty, poetry and hell, love and maybe some loss. At one point, I think we smell Coronavirus itself. Lord knows it’s coming for us. You dont choose to be an RX POSTMAN if you aren’t ready to face that possibility.<br><br>And like that, we’re out of there.  Honestly, Pine Meadows isn’t that bad. It smells a little funky and the tenants have a tendency of cornering me into wild cult sermons (more on that later), but mostly it’s just a weird place that people live. That’s what I hoping this WEBLOG will be about. An insight into the places we live, in a time we can’t leave, as someone who is payed money to leave my place and visit yours. It’s strange.<br><br>Maybe one day, I’ll find the words to understand and elaborate on the meaning of all this. Until then, I will write about how completely WACK Pine Meadows smells. Stay safe, strangers."
