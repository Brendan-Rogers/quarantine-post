# The Quarantine Post

The Quarantine Post is a Blog documenting my adventures as a RX postman. It's powered by an interactive JS command line, and a JSON file containing blog posts.

## Installation

Use node to install the required dependancies (just node-sass)

```bash
npm install the-quarantine-post
```
## Dependancies

It's just SASS on this one. Feel free to compile it however you'd like.
